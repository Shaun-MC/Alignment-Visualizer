Bug Report

"TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &=: 'bool' and 'NoneType'"

 Conditions to cause
    Single Alignment Type Button
    When a string is input, and a button setting is updated 
    When both strings are input, but one is removed
  
  Potential Fix: 
    Make sure there's two strings in S1, S2 before executing validation
